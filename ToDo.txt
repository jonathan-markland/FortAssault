Fort Assault to do
------------------

Post MVP
--------
[ ] Cartoonify the characters on the victory screen
[ ] The final boss gun looks terrible
[ ] Sound
[ ] Final boss must explode.
[ ] Easy | Med | Hard  -- and decide how this affects things!
    [ ] Scoring change with difficulty
[ ] The troop carrier ship needs to sail off in the sea battle.
[ ] Re-binding of records at the end of the screen should not use WITH -- explicitly state all fields.
[ ] Naming conventions :  "model" vs "oldState"
[ ] "Far splash" and "Near splash" distinction required on the sea battle screen.
[ ] The sea battle launch graphics re-uses the ImagePlaneBomb0 (etc) images
[ ] ResultOfProjectileCollisions - There was an intention that we could score according to type of thing hit, but the target isn't passed to this function yet, so we could only return a constant score, in which case there's no point in having a lambda return it!
[ ] ResultOfProjectileCollisionsWithSingleTarget - There was an intention that we could score according to type of thing hit, but the target isn't passed to this function yet, so we could only return a constant score, in which case there's no point in having a lambda return it!
[ ] Sea battle screen:  Ammunition not modelled yet.
[ ] Sea battle screen:  Reconnaisance planes
[ ] Sea battle screen:  Damage shown as percentage
[ ] Fort screen:  I may not wish to continue using the ship's explosion on the fort screen!!
[ ] Air battle screen:  The hit test region for the planes is constant throughout.  We could do 
    with calculating the region from the sprite extents, retrieved via the Flickbook module.
[ ] Sea battle screen: Should we model "enemy strength" as a factor passed between screens?
[ ] Sea battle screen: What will be the implication of letting the big ship escape?  Increase enemy strength.

Done
----

[X] Require more accuracy on final boss targets
[X] BUG:  The tank should not go down between the tank battle and the boss screen (ie: when the tank gets through!)
[X] Intermission screen to finish  'get ready'
[X] Enemy ship firing must have better sizing on the bombs in the distance.
[X] Poorly named:  CVOYetToAppear etc 
[X] Get rid of "level" number?
[X] Final boss - surrender flag must flutter
[X] Graphics re-done
[X] Bug:  Tank battle -- you get shot but still continue through to the boss if the screen-timer expires during the explosion sequence!
[X] The tanks repeat their firing pattern each screen repeat -- should be different
    Not a probkem:  Likely not be a problem if the tanks themselves are randomly appearing.
[X] Missiles must fire from tank cannon positions.
[X] Collision detection of missiles with enemy tanks is poor.  Remember that missile is rectangular.
[X] Gun movement left/right  must be related to seconds, not frames.
[X] Tank movement must be related to seconds not frames.
[X] Gun winding up/down speed must be related to seconds, not frames.
[X] Bug - Sea battle:  I don't think the elevation-to-hit works.
[X] Bug - Sea battle:  Sinking ships wobble.
[X] Integer coordinates in graphics interface to avoid scroll "seam" artifacts on tank battle, except for 
    things that are "superimposed sprite"-like.
[X] Victory screen
[X] PAUSE key
[X] We dont' have a decimal point on the angle in the UI.
[X] AMMUNITION readout is not used on the sea battle
[X] Bug - Sea battle:  Too sensitive on elevation change (throttle)

[X] Enter your name
[X] Hi score table on screen
[X] We now can't alter the gun elevation in the air battle quickly enough.
[X] Tune game parameters for MVP
[X] No score for sinking the ships!
[X] Hiscore goes to a GET READY followed by the main screen.  The GET READY should not be there.
[X] Declaring this OK.  Bug - hiscore display waits for fire to be pressed.  We should just time out.  
[X] Sea battle screen: Altering the gun angle is difficult.
[X] Sea battle screen: Score for ship sinking.
[X] Shortcut mode to somehow skip stages for test purposes.
[X] Investigate what coordinates should be returned to integers rather than floating point.
    Suspect only CentreImage should be floating point?
[X] Sea battle screen:  NO - Don't show elevation angle on this screen.
[X] Sea battle screen: Clear the advistory text after a little while.
[X] Sea battle screen: Damage shown (as percentage)
